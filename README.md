# Hi there, I'm Alexander! 👋

## About Me 🚀

- 🌱 Currently practising: Using left/right, full, inner and cross joins, as well as cementing my skills with writing queries. 
- 🔭 Working on: **Completing my EdD degree.** I have been studying part-time since September 2020, and enjoyed the statistical analysis of my quantitative data (based on six rounds of data collection using a psychometric testing questionnaire) so much that I'm looking to move into data analysis & data science. I have experience using R to calculate descriptive statistics, and conduct hypothesis testing and reliability calculations. 
- 🌍 Languages: English, with experience in R and basic Python. 

## Featured Projects 💻

### [EdD Quantitative Data Analysis](https://github.com/aeodeneal/edd_analysis)

The **EdD Quantitative Data Analysis** project includes the raw data collected resulting from the psychometric testing questionnaires completed as part of my EdD, as well as the R code written to complete the analysis. This project demonstrates my ability to calculate **descriptive and inferential statistics**, including measures of central tendency, quantiles, linear regression modeling, measures of correlation, conducting paired t-tests for dependent means, and Stuart-Maxwell tests. You can check out the repository [here](https://github.com/aeodeneal/edd_analysis).

### [SQL Project 2](https://github.com/aeodeneal/sql_project_2)

**SQL Project 2** is a more developed project I completed using SQL to analyze publicly available data to answer real examples of business questions. Unlike the first SQL project I completed, I started with a raw dataset and came up with the questions myself, and did not have guidance ot support me. You can see this repository [here](https://github.com/aeodeneal/sql_project_2). 

### [SQL Project 1](https://github.com/aeodeneal/sql_project_1)

**SQL project** is a simple project where I was required to use a number of SQL key words and statements to write a query to identify patterns relating to the mental health of international students at a Japanese university. You can see this repository [here](https://github.com/aeodeneal/sql_project_1).
